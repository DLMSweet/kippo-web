You will need the following installed packages (as well as any dependencies):
php,php-mysql,pecl-geoip
you'll also need kippo playback via Ajaxterm setup via:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kippousers/A6-xWxAElRY
For the lazy:
1. Get stuff and patch
wget http://yog-sothoth.dragonlight.fi/kippo-ajaxterm.tar.gz
wget http://yog-sothoth.dragonlight.fi/ajaxtermfix.patch
patch -p0 < ajaxterfix.patch

2. Open ajaxterm.py in editor and as Upi said - Grep for "/home/
desaster"... and fix the paths :-)

3. Run ajaxterm.py (no real need to install it even) and it will
listen on port 8022 by default

4. Set proxy in apache as below (or equivalent)
<Location /playlog>
    ProxyPass http://localhost:8022 ttl=60
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8022
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Location> 

Credit for that all to Tomasz Miklas and Upi Tamminen

I would *strongly* advise running ajaxterm as an umprivileged user.
